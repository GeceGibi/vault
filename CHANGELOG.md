## 1.0.1

This release fixes a reactivity/data-integrity bug affecting **dynamic sub-keys**
(keys created via the `call()` operator, e.g. `parent('alice')`). No public API
changes; existing code keeps working as-is.

### Reactivity & Caching

- **Bug Fix:** Sub-key instances now share a single value cache keyed by
  `storeName` instead of caching the value on each `KeepKey` object
  individually. Previously, since `call()` returns a brand new instance on
  every invocation (sub-keys are not memoized), two instances pointing at the
  same underlying entry could disagree: writing through one instance (or a
  `KeepBuilder`'s internal reload) would not be observed by another instance
  already holding a cached value, causing `read()`/`readSync()` to return
  stale data and reactive widgets to miss updates.
- **Bug Fix:** `Keep.clear()` and `Keep.clearRemovable()` now invalidate the
  entire shared value cache, not just the top-level keys tracked in the
  registry. Previously, a `KeepKey` sub-key instance held by the caller (e.g.
  a cached auth-token sub-key) could keep returning its pre-clear value from
  `read()`/`readSync()` even after the underlying data was deleted from disk,
  because sub-keys are never registered in `Keep`'s top-level key registry.

### Testing

- Fixed `test/removable_visual_test.dart`: the `extNonRemovable` key was
  mistakenly declared with `removable: true`, so the test never actually
  exercised the "non-removable keys survive `clearRemovable()`" case. It now
  uses `removable: false` and asserts the expected outcome instead of only
  printing it.

## 1.0.0

This is a major release focused on **data durability**, **reactivity correctness**,
and **concurrency safety**. Several long-standing bugs that could cause silent
data loss or stale UI have been fixed. Most changes are transparent to existing
code, but a few have behavioral implications — see _Migration Notes_ at the end.

### Durability (BREAKING)

- **Bug Fix:** `await keepKey.write(value)` for internal storage now blocks until
  the value is durably persisted to disk. Previously `saveMemory()` was
  fire-and-forget (`unawaited`), so a process crash immediately after
  `await write()` could lose the written value despite the apparent success.
- **Bug Fix:** `Keep.dispose()` now flushes all pending writes to disk before
  tearing down the writer queues. Previously pending debounced writes were
  cancelled and their data lost forever.
- **Bug Fix:** When a debounced pending operation is superseded by a newer one
  (`KeepWriteQueue.run`), the original caller's future is now resolved with the
  **successor's** outcome instead of being silently completed with `null`. This
  guarantees that `await write(...)` returning means data is persistent for
  every caller in a debounce chain, not just the most recent one.
- **New API:** `Keep.flush()` drains all pending writes to disk across both
  internal and external storage. Useful after fire-and-forget
  `unawaited(write(...))` patterns or before snapshotting the storage directory.
- **New API:** `KeepStorage.flush()` interface method (default no-op) lets
  storage adapters expose their flush semantics.
- **New API:** `KeepWriteQueue.flush()` waits for all in-flight and pending
  operations to settle without cancelling them; `awaitSettled(id)` waits for a
  specific id.

### Reactivity (BREAKING)

- **Bug Fix:** `KeepKey.remove()` now invalidates the in-memory value cache and
  emits a change event on `onChangeController`. Previously a removed key kept
  returning its stale cached value from `readSync()`/`read()`, and listeners
  (`KeepBuilder`, `key.stream`) never observed the removal.
- **Bug Fix:** `Keep.clear()` and `Keep.clearRemovable()` now invalidate the
  per-key caches of all (or removable) registered keys before notifying
  listeners.
- **Bug Fix:** `KeepBuilder` is now a `StatefulWidget` that holds the latest
  value in widget state. Previously the `StreamBuilder` + `FutureBuilder`
  combination issued a fresh `read()` future on every parent rebuild, causing
  flicker and transient `null` frames.

### Storage Engine

- **Bug Fix:** Concurrent external reads on the same key no longer return
  phantom `null` due to the writer queue's debounce. Reads now bypass the queue
  and use `awaitSettled` to observe in-flight writes without participating in
  cancellation.
- **Bug Fix:** External storage `read()` / `readSync()` no longer delete the
  underlying file when decoding returns `null`, completing the 0.7.0 fix that
  already removed this automatic deletion in error paths.
- **Bug Fix:** `KeepInternalStorage.read()` now awaits `Keep.ensureInitialized`
  so callers that bypass the `KeepKey` wrapper still observe a fully loaded
  memory map.

### Robustness

- **Bug Fix:** `Keep.init()` now wraps initialization in a `try/catch` and
  completes its internal completer with an error on failure. Previously a
  failed init left the completer permanently pending, causing every subsequent
  `ensureInitialized` await to hang forever.
- **Bug Fix:** `KeepKey.update()` now serializes concurrent atomic updates
  targeting the same key via a per-key mutex (`Keep.runSerialized`), preventing
  classic lost-update races where two callers read the same value and
  overwrite each other.
- **Bug Fix:** `SubKeyManager.toList()` no longer silently swallows header read
  errors; failures are now surfaced via `Keep.onError`.
- **Bug Fix:** All `onChangeController.add(...)` call sites guard against a
  closed controller, preventing crashes when a fire-and-forget write resolves
  after `Keep.dispose()`.

### Security

- **Improvement:** `SimpleKeepEncrypter` now asserts that `secureKey` is at
  least 8 characters long.
- **Improvement:** `Keep.init()` emits a debug-mode warning when the default
  fallback `SimpleKeepEncrypter` is used together with any `KeepKeySecure`,
  since the default key is a public constant that offers only basic
  obfuscation.

### Codec

- **Bug Fix:** `shiftBytes` and `unShiftBytes` no longer mutate their input
  buffer; they return a freshly allocated `Uint8List`. The defensive
  `Uint8List.fromList` copy inside `KeepCodecOf` has been removed since the
  mixin is now safe.

### Migration Notes

- `await keepKey.write(value)` for internal storage is now stricter about
  durability and therefore slower for sequential awaited writes (roughly
  matching external storage throughput). For high-frequency writes that
  previously relied on fire-and-forget semantics, switch to
  `unawaited(write(...))` followed by a single `await keep.flush()` at the
  appropriate flush point — supersede chaining still coalesces these into a
  single disk write while preserving durability for every awaiter.
- Custom `KeepStorage` implementations may override `flush()` to expose their
  own queue draining; the default implementation is a no-op.
- Code that depended on `shiftBytes` / `unShiftBytes` mutating in place must
  now use the returned `Uint8List`.

## 0.7.0
- **Performance:** Implemented `null` value caching in `KeepKeyPlain` and `KeepKeySecure` to prevent unnecessary repeated disk I/O when reading non-existent keys.
- **Performance:** Updated `write` methods to immediately cache the newly written value, avoiding an extra disk read on the subsequent `read` call.
- **Bug Fix:** Removed `unawaited(remove())` from the catch blocks in `read` and `readSync` methods for both `KeepKeyPlain` and `KeepKeySecure`. This prevents disastrous automatic deletion of user data when a simple parsing or schema error occurs.

## 0.6.0
- **Binary Codec (V2):** Switched from JSON-based encoding to `StandardMessageCodec` for significant performance gains and smaller storage footprint.
- **Improved Performance:** Optimized binary serialization for complex and nested data structures.
- **Auto-Migration:** Automatic seamless migration from V1 (JSON) to V2 (Binary) format on first write.
